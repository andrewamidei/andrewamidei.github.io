### Footnotes

Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]

[^1]: meaningful!

[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.
    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.
    `{ my code }`
    Add as many paragraphs as you like.

### Code

#### Inline code

Text inside `backticks` on a line will be formatted like code.

#### Code blocks

```js
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```

### Tables

|First Header | Second Header|
|------------ | ------------|
|Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2|
|Content in the first column | Content in the second column|

| Tables can be justified with a colon | Another example with a long title | And another long title as a example |
| :----------------------------------- | --------------------------------: | :---------------------------------: |
| because of the `:`                   |           these will be justified |          this is centered           |
|                                      |                                   |                                     |

If you put links in tables, they will work, but if you use [aliases](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Aliases), the pipe must be escaped with a `\` to prevent it being read as a table element.
